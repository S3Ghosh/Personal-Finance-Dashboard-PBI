# Personal-Finance-Dashboard-PowerBI
In this power BI project, I used DAX functions, Business Intelligence, and data visualization techniques to find out answers to relevant problems assoociated with the dataset. Problem Solving Approach:
* KPIs to know my income, expenses and available balance.
* Income and my target income to understand my goals
* Alerts for the month when payment is due
* Finding out the months when I have the highest and the lowest income
* Power Query â€“ To find distinct values as well as the range and presence of missing values.
* DAX Functions- For creating KPIs, financial formulae, calculated columns and measures.
* Visualizations- To create interactive dashboard.
* Highest income was in the months of January and August
* Lowest income was in the months of December and July
* Expenses are highest in December and lowest in July
* In the months of February, July, September, October and November there are no payments due. 
 Rest of the months have payments due.
